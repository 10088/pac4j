title: Security configuration&#58;
---

In most `pac4j` implementations, the security configuration must be defined via a [`Config`](https://github.com/pac4j/pac4j/blob/master/pac4j-core/src/main/java/org/pac4j/core/config/Config.java) object.

```java

```




To define the security configuration of the application, all clients are defined in the [`Clients`](https://github.com/pac4j/pac4j/blob/master/pac4j-core/src/main/java/org/pac4j/core/client/Clients.java) object, then or directly in the [`Config`]() object.
