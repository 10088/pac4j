title: What's new in pac4j v4.1?
author: Jérôme LELEU

One of the primary goals of pac4j has always been to be easy. One must admit that along the versions, it has gained some complexity and weight and time has come for cleaning.

Version 4.1 will be focused on cleaning (with none-breaking changes) and v5 as well (with breaking changes).

The documentation will be updated too.
