title: What's new in pac4j v5?

One of the primary goals of pac4j has always been to be easy. One must admit that along the versions, it has gained some complexity and weight and time has come for cleaning.

Version 5 will be focused on cleaning with breaking changes as was the version 4.1 (with none-breaking changes).

The documentation will be updated too.
